	<h1>Rebecca Schwilm</h1>
    	<p>I'm supposed to write about me, huh? It seems weird to do so, and I've never been one to talk about myself. Here goes.</p>
        <p>When I was little, I adored computers. I loved to play video games on my sister's mac, and I thought it was the coolest thing ever. Of course, I didn't know the internet was a thing. As I got older, I fell in love with websites. I never wanted to build them though - that was a "guy" thing to do, and I was the good girl who wanted to be a pretty teenager and act.</p>
        <p>Then I became a teenager. I started wanting to take electronics apart, and see how they worked. "She's going to be an engineer", my dad would say, a smile in his voice. My mom would shake her head and reply "No, she loves math. She's going to be an economist." They were both wrong, because in middle school we had a computer elective - the basics of HTML. I loved that class, more than anyone should. I honestly didn't think much of it afterwards, but every once in a while I'd go onto CodeAcademy and practice a little bit.</p>
        <p>Fast forward a few years, and I'm on maternity leave. I didn't have much to do after cleaning, and my doctors wanted me to rest as much as possible. I picked up CodeAcademy again, and I found my love for coding, just like in middle school. It was then that I decided I was going to go back to school, and I was going to go for Web Design and Development. It's funny - I still haven't lost the pride I feel whenever I make something work the way I wanted it to. Something as small as a paragraph being formatted right can change my whole day from a miserable one (and I work at a car dealership, it can happen easily), to the best day of my life so far.</p>
        <p>There have been times where I've wanted to give up, because I'm so stressed from schoolwork and a fulltime job and being a mother. Then my daughter (only a year and a half old) will look at me and say "mama?", like she knows what I'm thinking. She'll come on over and give me a hug, and I know I need to keep going so I can prove to her that it's never too late to follow your dreams.</p>

        	<h3>Navigation Bar - Featured Item!</h3>

            <img src="img/nav_px_size.png" alt="Navigation Bar Pixel Breakdown" />
            <p>This navigation bar makes a statement, and is rather simple, yet powerful looking. It's a perfect navigation bar for a website used as a portfolio, as it gives all relevant information. With this navigation bar, it also makes it very easy to see which page of the website you are on. To make this navigation section (nav) would contain a an unordered list (ul, li). Each list item contains a link (a) to the correct page.</p>
            <p>The background of the navigation bar is a gradient from hex color #1b1917 to #383532. When you are on a certain page, that tab turns to a gray color (hex #5b5a58).</p>

        	<h3>Footer</h3>
            <img src="img/footer.png" alt="Footer" />
            <p>This footer is larger than most, but it is easy to navigate. It shows the most pertinent information for contact and location right away, along with a map and links to social media for the company. There's also a button to take you right to the top of the page! This footer (footer) would have 3 icons (img) with text (p) in their own sections (div, p, address). Under that, another section (section, div) with text (p) and icons (img), and a map (api documentation, address).  </p>

        <article id="subscribeEx">
        	<h3>Welcoming "Subscribe" box</h3>
            <img src="img/welcome_modal.png" alt="Subscribe" />
            <p>This is a "subscribe" box that opens when you first visit the homepage. It allows the user to subscribe right away, and often get a coupon when they first visit a store's online site, or (as in this case) get a newsletter from the website! This div (div) would have text about subscribing (p) with a very basic form for the email (form, email). There would also be a button (button) and an x (p, button) to close the div/modal.</p>

        <article id="ctaEx">
        	<h3>Call to Action</h3>
            <img src="img/CTA.png" alt="Call to Action" />
            <p>A call to action invites the user to continue on a path, and typically is led into gently. The goal of the template here is to book a client, and it leads the customer to click to get more information on how to learn more about the design/development business before contacting them about a quote. This section (section, article, div, aside) would hold a heading (h1, h2, h3, etc) with another line of text (h2, h3, h4, etc, p). There would also be a styled button (button) with some text on it.</p>

        	<h3>Working Contact Form</h3>
            <img src="img/contact_form_working.png" alt="Working Contact Form" />
            <p>This is a working contact form with a message space. When a user fills in the form and submits it, it sends a message to an email. There would be a form (form) with a spot for a name (text), email (text, email), and message (textarea). There would also be a submit button (button).</p>
