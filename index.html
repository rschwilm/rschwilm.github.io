	<h1>Rebecca Schwilm</h1>
    	<p>Rebecca is a 22 year old aspiring web designer, with a love for Photoshop. While she's still working on her color theory, she has done a handful of small freelance graphic design jobs, and is growing her ability every day. In addition to being a student at Full Sail University, she is also a full time Internet Sales Manager at a car dealership where she manages incoming leads and oversees communications with said leads. Recently, she has been training as an on-the-floor sales team member, and is hoping the extra hours do not affect her schoolwork, although the income is welcome. </p>
        <p>When she's not wheeling and dealing, or typing at a computer, Rebecca enjoys playing with her one and a half year old daughter and going out for "family days" as often as possible. She and her boyfriend often enjoy a day out at the range, or a night at home alone while Grandma watches their daughter.</p>
    	<p>When Rebecca graduates, she hopes to work with a local company, Higher Images, who does internet marketing and websites for companies across the globe.</p>

     	<h2>Components I Would Like to Use:</h2>
        <nav>
        	<ul>
     		   <li><a href="#navEx">Navigation Bar</a></li> |
               <li><a href="#footerEx">Footer</a></li> |
               <li><a href="#subscribeEx">Subscribe Modal</a></li> |
               <li><a href="#ctaEx">Call to Action</a></li> |
               <li><a href="#contactFormEx">Contact Form</a></li>
            </ul>
     	</nav>
     	<article id="navEx">
        	<h3>Navigation Bar - Featured Item!</h3>
        	<img src="img/nav_bar.png" alt="Navigation Bar" /><br><br>
            <img src="img/nav_px_size.png" alt="Navigation Bar Pixel Breakdown" />
            <p>This navigation bar makes a statement, and is rather simple, yet powerful looking. It's a perfect navigation bar for a website used as a portfolio, as it gives all relevant information. With this navigation bar, it also makes it very easy to see which page of the website you are on. To make this navigation section (nav) would contain a an unordered list (ul, li). Each list item contains a link (a) to the correct page.</p>
            <p>The background of the navigation bar is a gradient from hex color #1b1917 to #383532. When you are on a certain page, that tab turns to a gray color (hex #5b5a58).</p>
            <button><a href="Components/nav_bar/nav_bar.html">See This Component!</a></button>
        </article>
     	<article id="footerEx">
        	<h3>Footer</h3>
            <img src="img/footer.png" alt="Footer" />
            <p>This footer is larger than most, but it is easy to navigate. It shows the most pertinent information for contact and location right away, along with a map and links to social media for the company. There's also a button to take you right to the top of the page! This footer (footer) would have 3 icons (img) with text (p) in their own sections (div, p, address). Under that, another section (section, div) with text (p) and icons (img), and a map (api documentation, address).  </p>
            <button><a href="Components/footer/footer.html">See This Component!</a></button>
        </article>
        <article id="subscribeEx">
        	<h3>Welcoming "Subscribe" box</h3>
            <img src="img/welcome_modal.png" alt="Subscribe" />
            <p>This is a "subscribe" box that opens when you first visit the homepage. It allows the user to subscribe right away, and often get a coupon when they first visit a store's online site, or (as in this case) get a newsletter from the website! This div (div) would have text about subscribing (p) with a very basic form for the email (form, email). There would also be a button (button) and an x (p, button) to close the div/modal.</p>
        </article>
        <article id="ctaEx">
        	<h3>Call to Action</h3>
            <img src="img/CTA.png" alt="Call to Action" />
            <p>A call to action invites the user to continue on a path, and typically is led into gently. The goal of the template here is to book a client, and it leads the customer to click to get more information on how to learn more about the design/development business before contacting them about a quote. This section (section, article, div, aside) would hold a heading (h1, h2, h3, etc) with another line of text (h2, h3, h4, etc, p). There would also be a styled button (button) with some text on it.</p>
        </article>
        <article id="contactFormEx">
        	<h3>Working Contact Form</h3>
            <img src="img/contact_form_working.png" alt="Working Contact Form" />
            <p>This is a working contact form with a message space. When a user fills in the form and submits it, it sends a message to an email. There would be a form (form) with a spot for a name (text), email (text, email), and message (textarea). There would also be a submit button (button).</p>
