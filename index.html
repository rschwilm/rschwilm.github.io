	<h1>Rebecca Schwilm</h1>
    	<p>Rebecca is a 22 year old aspiring web designer, with a love for photoshop. While she's still working on her color theory, she has done a handful of small freelance graphic design jobs, and is growing her ability everyday. In addition to being a student at Full Sail University, she is also a full time Internet Sales Manager at a car dealership where she managaes incoming leads and oversees communications with said leads. Recently, she has been training as an on-the-floor sales team member, and is hoping the extra hours do not affect her schoolwork, although the income is welcome. </p>
        <p>When she's not wheeling and dealing, or typing at a computer, Rebecca enjoys playing with her one and a half year old daughter and going out for "family days" as often as possible. She and her boyfriend often enjoy a day out at the range, or a night at home alone while Grandma watches their daughter.</p>
    	<p>When Rebecca graduates, she hopes to work with a local company, Higher Images, who does internet marketing and websites for companies across the globe.</p>
